title: Understanding Datasets and Distributions 
---


<h2>What is a Dataset?</h2>
<p>
A <strong>dataset</strong> is a structured collection of data. It can be represented as a table with rows and columns, 
where each row corresponds to an observation and each column represents a variable or feature. 
Datasets are essential in data analysis, statistics, and machine learning, as they provide the foundation for discovering patterns, relationships, and trends.
</p>

<p>
For example, a dataset about people might include their age, height, and weight. This data can later be used to study distributions, correlations, and predictions.
</p>

<h3>Example Dataset</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Person</th>
    <th>Age</th>
    <th>Height (cm)</th>
    <th>Weight (kg)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alice</td>
    <td>25</td>
    <td>165</td>
    <td>60</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bob</td>
    <td>30</td>
    <td>175</td>
    <td>72</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Charlie</td>
    <td>22</td>
    <td>180</td>
    <td>75</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>What is a Distribution?</h2>
<p>
A <strong>distribution</strong> describes how the values of a variable are spread or arranged. It shows the frequency or probability 
of each possible outcome. Distributions are fundamental in statistics, as they allow us to summarize and understand data behavior.
</p>

<p>
There are two main types of statistical distributions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Discrete distribution</strong> – deals with countable outcomes (e.g., number of login attempts).</li>
  <li><strong>Continuous distribution</strong> – deals with outcomes that can take any value within a range (e.g., height, weight).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Univariate Distribution Example</h2>
<p>
A <strong>univariate distribution</strong> focuses on a single variable. 
Below we compute the frequency distribution of <em>Age</em> from our dataset.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">
-- Frequency distribution of Age
SELECT Age, COUNT(*) AS Frequency
FROM People
GROUP BY Age
ORDER BY Age;
</code></pre>

<h3>Output</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Age</th>
    <th>Frequency</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>22</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>25</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>30</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Bivariate Distribution Example</h2>
<p>
A <strong>bivariate distribution</strong> examines the relationship between two variables.
Here we look at how <em>Height</em> and <em>Weight</em> are distributed together.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">
-- Bivariate distribution of Height and Weight
SELECT Height, Weight
FROM People
ORDER BY Height;
</code></pre>

<h3>Output</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Height (cm)</th>
    <th>Weight (kg)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>165</td>
    <td>60</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>175</td>
    <td>72</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>180</td>
    <td>75</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>The Caesar Cipher: An Application of Distributions</h2>
<p>
The <strong>Caesar cipher</strong> is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It's a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, 'D' would be replaced by 'A', 'E' would become 'B', and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
</p>

<h3>Interactive Caesar Cipher Tool</h3>
<p>
Enter text below. A <strong>random shift key</strong> between 1 and 25 will be automatically generated and applied. The tool will then attempt to crack the cipher using language frequency analysis.
