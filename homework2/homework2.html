title: Understanding Datasets and Distributions 
---


<h2>What is a Dataset?</h2>
<p>
A <strong>dataset</strong> is a structured collection of data. It can be represented as a table with rows and columns, 
where each row corresponds to an observation and each column represents a variable or feature. 
Datasets are essential in data analysis, statistics, and machine learning, as they provide the foundation for discovering patterns, relationships, and trends.
</p>

<p>
For example, a dataset about people might include their age, height, and weight. This data can later be used to study distributions, correlations, and predictions.
</p>

<h3>Example Dataset</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Person</th>
    <th>Age</th>
    <th>Height (cm)</th>
    <th>Weight (kg)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alice</td>
    <td>25</td>
    <td>165</td>
    <td>60</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bob</td>
    <td>30</td>
    <td>175</td>
    <td>72</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Charlie</td>
    <td>22</td>
    <td>180</td>
    <td>75</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>What is a Distribution?</h2>
<p>
A <strong>distribution</strong> describes how the values of a variable are spread or arranged. It shows the frequency or probability 
of each possible outcome. Distributions are fundamental in statistics, as they allow us to summarize and understand data behavior.
</p>

<p>
There are two main types of statistical distributions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Discrete distribution</strong> – deals with countable outcomes (e.g., number of login attempts).</li>
  <li><strong>Continuous distribution</strong> – deals with outcomes that can take any value within a range (e.g., height, weight).</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Univariate Distribution Example</h2>
<p>
A <strong>univariate distribution</strong> focuses on a single variable. 
Below we compute the frequency distribution of <em>Age</em> from our dataset.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">
-- Frequency distribution of Age
SELECT Age, COUNT(*) AS Frequency
FROM People
GROUP BY Age
ORDER BY Age;
</code></pre>

<h3>Output</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Age</th>
    <th>Frequency</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>22</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>25</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>30</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Bivariate Distribution Example</h2>
<p>
A <strong>bivariate distribution</strong> examines the relationship between two variables.
Here we look at how <em>Height</em> and <em>Weight</em> are distributed together.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">
-- Bivariate distribution of Height and Weight
SELECT Height, Weight
FROM People
ORDER BY Height;
</code></pre>

<h3>Output</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Height (cm)</th>
    <th>Weight (kg)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>165</td>
    <td>60</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>175</td>
    <td>72</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>180</td>
    <td>75</td>
  </tr>
</table>
