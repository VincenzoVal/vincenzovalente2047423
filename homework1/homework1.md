# What is statistics and why can it be useful for cybersecurity

Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to make informed decisions under uncertainty. 
In today’s digital world, vast amounts of data are generated every second—from social media interactions to complex network logs. 
As cyber threats grow in frequency and sophistication, the ability to extract insights from data has become essential. 
Statistical reasoning enables cybersecurity professionals to move from intuition-based to data-driven defense strategies, identifying patterns and anomalies that may indicate malicious activity.

## What is statistics?
Statistics is the branch of mathematics concerned with data analysis and interpretation. It has two primary branches:
 - **Descriptive Statistics**, which summarize data through measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation;
 - **Inferential Statistics**, which allow predictions or generalizations based on samples, using hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression models.
This principle holds especially true in cybersecurity, where every log file or network trace contains potential evidence of threats.

## Why Statistics is Useful in Cybersecurity
The core of cybersecurity is identifying malicious activity within a sea of normal data. 
Statistics provides the mathematical tools necessary to automate this process and discover patterns invisible to the human eye.
Here are some applications of statistics in the world of cyber security:

**ANOMALY DETECTION AND THREAT HUNTING** <br>
A primary use of statistics is in anomaly detection. Security systems first use statistical methods to build a baseline of what normal user and network behavior looks like. 
Any event that is a statistically significant deviation from this baseline is flagged as a potential threat. This approach is crucial for threat hunting and identifying novel "zero-day" attacks.

**QUANTITATIVE RISK MANAGMENT** <br>
Statistics provides the methods to perform quantitative risk analysis. Instead of just saying a data breach is "likely," statistical models can calculate the probability of 
an event based on historical data and industry trends. This quantitative data helps executives make informed decisions about investing in security controls and purchasing cyber insurance.

**VULNERABILITY PRIORIZATION** <br>
Modern organizations face a constant stream of new security vulnerabilities (CVEs). Deciding which ones to fix first is a massive challenge. 
Statistics offers a solution through predictive models. A prime example is the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS). 
This system uses statistical models to analyze data on thousands of vulnerabilities and real-world exploit data ("in the wild"). 
The result is a probability score (from 0 to 100%) that a specific vulnerability will be exploited in the next 30 days. 
Instead of relying solely on a generic severity rating, security teams can use this statistical probability to focus their resources on the most imminent and likely threats.

**DIGITAL FORENSICS AND INCIDENT RESPONSE (DFIR)** <br>
After a security incident has occurred, statistics play a key role in forensic analysis. Digital investigators analyze vast amounts of log data, network traffic, 
and system files to reconstruct an attacker's actions. Statistical analysis helps them identify patterns and anomalies in the historical data. 
For example, they can use regression analysis to correlate spikes in network traffic with unauthorized file access, or use time-series analysis to pinpoint the exact moment 
a system's behavior began to deviate from the norm. This data-driven approach makes it possible to find concrete evidence and distinguish malicious activity from background noise.
